=== Responsiblity

This Menu inheritates from link:CloseableMenu.adoc[CloseableMenu]. The `Show()` method is overriden to include
Instantiation of the needed buttons. The primary context action button (`Consume`, `Use`, `Equip`) is added here.
If the link:../Inventory/InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem] can be dropped, a `Drop`-Button is also shown.

`Hide()` is overridden to Destroy the created context action buttons.

=== Use

This script is used on the InventoryContextMenu-prefab, which is instantiated by link:../Inventory/InventoryDisplay.adoc[InventoryDisplay]
