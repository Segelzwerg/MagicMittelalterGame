=== Responsibility

This class is a base class for all menus, that can be closed, for example Inventories, PauseMenus and Dialogs.

It features menu-stacking, which makes a complex menu navigation easy and quick to implement. When a new menu is opened, it will be added
to the Stack of opened menus. Pressing `ESC`, or calling `Hide()` on any menu will cause the top menu to close first.

Subclasses of this script can be used to create new menues.

_Please make sure to override `Show()` and `Hide()`, and include `base.Show()` and `base.Hide()` respectively in the overridden methods._

=== How to create a new menu

* Create a new Script, and add `CloseableMenu` as upper class: `public class MyNewMenu : CloseableMenu`

* Override `Show()`, `Hide()` and (optionally) `Toggle()`:
[source,c-sharp]
----
public class MyNewMenu : CloseableMenu
{
    public override void Show()
    {
        base.Show();
        [...]
    }
    
    public override void Hide()
    {
        base.Hide();
        [...]
    }
}
----

* Attach your new script to the parent object of your menu canvas. `Important: The script cannot be attached to the GameObject, that is supposed to be disabled, because it cannot be enabled again`.

* Reference your menu GameObject under `Menu Object`

==== Closing the menu

* To close your new menu, reference the `Hide()` method of your new menu in the button/script that is supposed to close the menu.

_Example: From a Button/Method_
[source,c-sharp]
----
public class NewMenu : CloseableMenu
{
    public void CloseNewMenu_Click()
    {
        this.Hide();
    }
}
----

_Example: From another class:_
----
public class Controller : MonoBehavior
{
    NewMenu menu; //Reference to menu script in inspector
    public void CloseNewMenu()
    {
        menu.Hide();
    }
}
----

==== Opening the menu

* To open a submenu, reference the `Show()` method of the new submenu in your button.

_Example: From a Button/Method of another class:_
[source,c-sharp]
----
public class PauseMenu : CloseableMenu
{
    NewMenu menu; //Reference to new menu script in inspector
    public override void Show()
    {
        base.Show();
        [...]
    }
    
    public override void Hide()
    {
        base.Hide();
        [...]
    }
    
    public void SubMenuButton_Click()
    {
        menu.Show();
    }
}
----

=== Required Components
* Menu Object (Transform)
    ** The GameObject that should be enabled/disabled. _Note: The Menu script cannot be attached to this GameObject_
* Active (bool)
    ** For internal use; shows status of menu
* Hide If Not On Top (bool)
    ** Choose to hide the menu, if another menu gets opened on top (e.g. used in Menus with Transparency (link:PauseMenu.adoc[PauseMenu]))
