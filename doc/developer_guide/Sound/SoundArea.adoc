= Sound Areas

== Why use `Sound Areas`?

`Sound Areas` are useful for closed rooms to create special effects and/or isolate outside sounds.

== How to setup a `Sound Area`


In order to add a sound area to your scene, create a empty object in the `Areas` folder.

=== Components

Than you need to add a box collider which is at least as high the max. position of the player's feet box collider.
It also must be set to `Is Trigger`.

=== Script

Next there are two ways to add logic to the object.

1. Add the `GenericArea` script, but in order to play a playlist other than the default one, you need to add the name
of the playlist in the `playlist` field.

2. You can add a custom script, which inherits from `SoundArea`, but it must implement at least `OnTriggerEnter` and
must call

[source,c-sharp]
----
if (other.name != "Player") return;
GameObject.Find("Player").GetComponent<MusicManager>().XXX();
----

where `XXX()` is a trigger in the `MusicManager`. It's recommended to implement a `OnTriggerExit`: 

[source,c-sharp]
----
private void OnTriggerExit(Collider other)
{
    if (other.name == "GroundDetector")
    {
        GameObject.Find("Player").GetComponent<MusicManager>().Background("Default");
    }
}
