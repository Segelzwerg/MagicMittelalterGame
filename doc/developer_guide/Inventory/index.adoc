=== How it works (code wise)

The Inventory is split into link:Inventory.adoc[Inventory] and link:InventoryDisplay.adoc[InventoryDisplay].

link:Inventory.adoc[Inventory] manages the actual Array of link:InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem].
This class uses a small amount of Logic, most of the methods are delegates to link:InventoryDisplay.adoc[InventoryDisplay].

For every Inventory Item Category there is a subclass of link:InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem].
The 4 attributes `consumable`, `useable`, `equippable` and `droppable` are defined by category by default, but can be adjusted individually.

link:InventoryDisplay.adoc[InventoryDisplay] handles Displaying the Inventory as Menu. It uses link:../Menu/CloseableMenu.adoc[CloseableMenu] for main functionality.
After Showing the menu, `RefreshDisplay()` is called. This method sorts the Items using the selected SortMethod. After Sorting the instancing of 
link:InventorySlot.adoc[InventorySlot]s is done by looping through the sorted link:InventorySlot.adoc[InventorySlot] Array from link:Inventory.adoc[Inventory].

_Please note, that "RefreshDisplay()" has to be called after changing the player inventory contents in order to show the new contents, or errors might occur._

Inventory Sorting can be adjusted by changing `sortMethod` in link:InventoryDisplay.adoc[InventoryDisplay]. Default sorting is `ascending`. Please set `sortDescending` to `true` to change this.

==== Interaction with environment

Picking up items can be done by calling `Pickup(link:InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem])`, from an link:../Interaction/Interactable.adoc[Interactable] or any other script.

Dropping items teleports the gameObject of attached link:InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem] to the ItemDropLocation Transform position and enabled it there, before Removing it from the own inventory.
