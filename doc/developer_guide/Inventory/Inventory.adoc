=== Responsibility

Inventory handles the management of inventory items and includes basic delegate methods for link: InventoryDisplay.adoc[InventoryDisplay].

Picking up items is done by calling the method `Pickup(link:InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem])` from (for example) an link:../Interaction/Interactable.adoc[Interactable].
The method checks if picking up the new item would exceed the `SlotLimit` or `WeightLimit`, and denies the pickup if it does.

Removing/Dropping items can be done by calling `Remove(link:InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem] [,bool])`. Passing `true` to the optional boolean parameter will destroy the link:InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem]'s
game object upon removal from the inventory.

The inventory is automatically refreshed after pickup/removing an link: InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem].
