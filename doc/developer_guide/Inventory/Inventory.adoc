=== Responsibility

Inventory handels the management of inventory items and includes basic delegate methods for link: InventoryDisplay.adoc[InventoryDisplay].

Picking up items is done by calling the method `Pickup(InventoryItem)` from (for example) an link: ../Interaction/Interactable.adoc[Interactable].
The method checks, if picking up the new item would exceed the `SlotLimit` or `WeightLimit`, and deny the Pickup if so.

Removing/Dropping items can be done by calling `Remove(InventoryItem <,bool>)`. The boolean value = `true` can be used to destroy the link: InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem]s
game object upon Removal from inventory.

The inventory is automatically refreshed after Pickup/Removing an link: InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem].
