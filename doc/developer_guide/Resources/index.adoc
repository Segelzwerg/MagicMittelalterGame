= Resources

== Loading Resources

Resources must be placed in any folder inside `Assets/Resources/`. Than you can load them with

[source,c-sharp]
----
T x = Resources.Load<T>(path);
----

where `path` is the relative path from `Resources` and must not contain the file ending. So for loading the `cave` track
you would use:

[source,c-sharp]
----
AudioClip cave = Resources.Load<AudioClip>("Music/A1-Cave");
----
