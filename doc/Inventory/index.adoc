== Inventory module


==== Submodules
link:Inventory.adoc[Inventory class]

link:InventoryDisplay.adoc[InventoryDisplay class]

==== Required Components
link:../Player/PlayerProperties.adoc[PlayerProperties]


==== How it works (code wise)

The Inventory is split into link:Inventory.adoc[Inventory] and link:InventoryDisplay.adoc[InventoryDisplay].

link:Inventory.adoc[Inventory] manages the actual Array of link:InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem].
This class uses a small amount of Logic, most of the methods are delegates to link:InventoryDisplay.adoc[InventoryDisplay].

For every Inventory Item Category there is a subclass of link:InventoryItem.adoc[InventoryItem].
The 4 attributes `consumable`, `useable`, `equippable` and `droppable` are defined by category by default, but can be adjusted individually.
